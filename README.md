# SelenWebscrape
Selenium Webscraper

the basic framework for getting info from Webscraper. 

uses text docs and your choice of url

next feture is all custom inputs for libraries, and perminate memory for answers.

may expand into custom user profiles.

could lead to a project with mutliple webscraping libraries that test if they can get the information.

keep in mind selen can be slow. it will be the bottle neck, but more reliable that BS4
